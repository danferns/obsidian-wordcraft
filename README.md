# WordCraft

Find rhymes, synonyms, and describing words from within Obsidian. Designed for songwriting and poetry.

Search Modes:

-   Means like... (thesaurus / reverse dictionary)
-   Rhymes with... (also includes near rhymes)
-   Nouns described by... (endless -> sea)
-   Adjectives that describe... (sea -> endless)

If you wish, you may specify a couple of `Themes` to skew the results towards them. Nouns work best.

Click on a word from the results to repeat the search on it. Noun and Adjective modes will swap, so clicking on a _noun_ will trigger a search for _adjectives_ that describe the noun.

You may filter words for [syllabic stress patterns](https://youtu.be/JMxzLOSlhbs):
- `/` is a stressed syllable.
- `x` is an unstressed syllable.
