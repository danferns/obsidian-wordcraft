# WordCraft

Find rhymes, synonyms, and describing words from within Obsidian. Designed for songwriting and poetry.

Search Modes:

-   Means like... (thesaurus / reverse dictionary)
-   Rhymes with... (also includes near rhymes)
-   Nouns to describe... (endless -> sea)
-   Adjectives that describe... (sea -> endless)

Click on a word from the results to search further. Noun and Adjective modes will swap. So clicking on a _noun_ will trigger a search for _adjectives_ that describe the noun.

You may use the `Topics` box to provide the system with contextual hints.
